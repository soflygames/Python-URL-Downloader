# Python-URL-Downloader

A script I made to download 8000 mp3s files from Alex Jones Website 
before the archives disappears for good, like I suspect..

I downloaded the Rss File from His website and ran python string functions 
to snip away anything I didnt need. In other word to process the 8000 or so MP3 urls, then I added a comma
to the end of every line. Those python snippits can also be found in my repo.
